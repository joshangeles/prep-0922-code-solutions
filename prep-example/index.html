    <!-- write your app ideas here ðŸ‘‡ -->
    As a music lover, I would love to build an easy organizational app for events. It'd be fun to funnel a passion that I have into an app that my friends and I could use to factor in expenses and time required. This is because we frequently find ourselves scrambling to assemble an excel sheet to schedule and organize everything, and I would like to make something that is a bit easier on the eyes.
